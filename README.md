## Projects

🔹 [**MindPulse AI: Real-Time Analytics for Mental Health**](https://github.com/atremante26/Mental_Health_Project)  
Real-time mental health data platform powered by LLMs and ML models, built to uncover insights and raise awareness around mental health trends.  
→ Cloud-native data pipeline (Airflow, Snowflake, S3, Great Expectations) + full-stack app (FastAPI, React, Vite) on EKS with Docker and CloudWatch.

🔹 [**Match_Prediction_Model**](https://github.com/atremante26/Match_Prediction_Model)  
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using PyTorch to predict professional soccer matches based on historical betting data.  
→ 50% return on investment (ROI) in simulated weekly betting performance. 

🔹 [**Personal Website**](https://github.com/atremante26/Personal_Website)  
Full-stack personal portfolio website using React, Django, Node, and PostgreSQL, hosted on Render and GitHub Pages.  
→ UI designs and 3D visualizations using Tailwind CSS and Three.js.

## Research

My senior honors thesis explores how **logical equivalence** can be used to better evaluate SQL outputs from text-to-SQL models.  
Currently working with [VeriEQL](https://github.com/VeriEQL/VeriEQL) framework to support real-world databases with constraints.
